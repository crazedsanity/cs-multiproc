 This library requires two classes from the cs-content system 
 (http://sf.net/projects/cs-content):
  * cs_fileSystemClass.php
  * cs_globalFunctions.php

While it is recommended to acquire the cs-content system in it's entirety, the 
classes can be downloaded via SVN at:

https://cs-content.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cs-content/releases/0.7/

There may be newer versions available.  You may also want to try using the 
"bleeding-edge" versions at:
