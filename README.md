PHP-Based Multi-Thread Libraries
==============

Okay, okay, it's actually using multiple processes, not threads.  I found that out after I named the project...

The system is built to track the progress and output of scripts to a database.  An application can then be used to display the information (possibly in near-realtime).  I haven't spent time building the web interface yet, but it's been planned. Let me know if you'd like to help.
